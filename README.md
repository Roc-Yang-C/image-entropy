# image-entropy

This is a simple Python3 program to read image files and obtain their entropy content
in a simple and straightforward manner.

For that it uses the **Pillow** (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/3.2.0)
and **NumPy** (http://www.numpy.org) libraries.

The repository includes two sample images to get you started.
